// TODO : Simplify the process dramatically.
// 1. Bind click event to links/thumbnails.
// 2. After user clicked on on thumbnail, find its index.
// 3. Create an array of slide objects from DOM elements â€“ loop through all
//    links and retrieve href attribute (large image url), data-size attribute
//    (its size), src of thumbnail, and contents of caption.

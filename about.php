                    After studying Fine Art at Falmouth University, Nancy has
                    continued to live and work in Falmouth, Cornwall.

                    Her preoccupation with place and the landscape is the
                    main influence for her work, attempting to capture part
                    of the Genis Loci of a place. Looking at the relationship
                    between painter and place, Nancy aims to transpose this
                    connection on to canvas.

                    Working mainly from films she has collected from car windows,
                    train journeys and walks, Nancy is able to continue to
                    experience the landscape while watching the films back in her
                    studio. She then approaches painting in stages, building up
                    layers of paint. With each wash an image can be morphed into
                    the memory of what has been seen and experienced; creating an
                    image which alludes to the distortion of memory due to our
                    emotional connection with particular places.
